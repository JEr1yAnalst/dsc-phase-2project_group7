## Project overview
The aim of this project is to analyze the King County House Sales dataset, which comprises data from house sales in King County, spanning the years 2014 to 2015. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of various factors influencing house prices in the region, including location, size, condition, and other relevant attributes. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, we seek to gain insights into the factors that drive house prices in King County and to build predictive models to estimate house prices accurately.

We use an iterative process to prepare and model our data while utilizing exploratory data analysis to better understand our dataset. Next, we try to iterate across models using various statistical techniques in order to identify the model with the best statistical R-Squared Value, RMSE, and differential values.

## Business understanding
The following are the goals which we have addressed with in this analysis:

Explore and understand the structure and content of the King County House Sales dataset.
Perform descriptive analysis to gain insights into key features, trends, and patterns in the data.
Identify factors that significantly influence house prices in King County.
Build predictive models to estimate house prices based on relevant features and attributes.
Evaluate and validate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to stakeholders.

## Data understanding
This project utilizes the King County House Sales dataset, which is available in the kc_house_data.csv file located in the data folder of this GitHub repository. A comprehensive description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in the same folder. While the column names provide some information, it is important to note that further research or informed judgment may be necessary to fully understand the meaning of the data.

The analysis performed on the dataset included the following steps:
1. Data cleaning and preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Pre-processing
By performing these steps, we aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and prepare it for further analysis and modeling
